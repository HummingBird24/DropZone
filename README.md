iOS Application
# Description
DropZone allows low income families or those currently homeless to find events near their location that are providing food, toiletries, clothing, shelter, etc. The web platform that can be found here: http://students.engr.scu.edu/~stamizha/dropzone.html provides an area for any organization to post events they are hosting. The events are then pulled from a server onto the DropZone application which displays all details of the posted events including a map view that shows all events and can give turn by turn navigation.
